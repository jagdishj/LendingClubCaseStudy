## General Information

This case study involving the consumer finance company and analyzing the risk of loans.

Consumer finance company specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision.

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

Our objective is to identify the loans which are risky and have a tendency to be defaulted.

## Conclusions

- Employees with more than 10 years of experience needs to have a watch as they are highly funded
- Low grade loans are more defaulted
- States with highest defaulters needs to be watched. 
- Loans are yielding profits and are having a positive impact. So far, the results are good.
- Company should also diversify their loans to other categories as most of the loans are going to small business and housing loans
- Company should also diversify their loans to employees with lesser experience as well as they are funding most of the employees with more than 10 years of experience
- Other states(other than ‘CA’ and ‘IA’) should be funded more loans to diversify the portfolio.
- Analysis needs to be done as to why so many loan applications are coming for debt consolidation purpose.
